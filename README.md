# Panda Pile

**Status**: Superseded by https://github.com/worm-blossom/ufotofu. See also [this essay (draft)](https://github.com/AljoschaMeyer/lazy_on_principle/blob/main/main.pdf) for an updated design rationale.

Synchronous and asynchronous rust traits for lazily producing and consuming sequences, avoiding some design issues with the traits in the standard library. See the [docs](https://docs.rs/panda_pile/) for more info.
